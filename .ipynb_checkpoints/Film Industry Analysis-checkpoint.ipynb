    "# The Project\n",
    ">Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",

    "**The Fanbase factor:**\n",
    "> `Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi`, `Adventure, Animation, Comedy` and `Action, Adventure, Fantasy` have been very popular over the last ten years. They are competitive `genres` with the most No. of Movies in the Top 1% of movies in terms of number of votes. <br><br>I think the reason is that most of these movies are **superhero movies (Captain America, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Wonder Woman)**. Or part of a **movie series (Avengers, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Toy Story, Despicable Me)** or **Pixar Movies**. <br><br>\n",

The good thing about a partnership is that they wouldn't have to develop a new story since they would use an existing character. <br><br>\n",

    "# Answer:\n",
    "> Based on the chart above, we can see that the **Average No. of Votes increases as the No. of Regions in which the movie is played increases**. Therefore, my recommendation for Microsoft would be to prepare to **launch the film internationally**.\n",

    "# Conclusions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusions\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "**1. The Film Industry is a competitive and growing market:** The supply of new movies is increasing over the years. The reason for that can be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movies have become cheaper to make over time.\n",
    "- The market and customer base grew. So the demand for more content is growing.\n",
    "- People have access to the internet + Consumers are moving from Cable TV to On-Demand subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are all positive reasons for Microsoft to enter the Film Industry. The only problem is that competition has grown a lot, and Microsoft will compete with Apple, Netflix, Disney, and YouTube. Moreover, there's a lot of discussions on the subscription market's saturation, so their pricing will have to be competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Documentary, Drama, and Comedy are the most popular genres in No. of Movies:** After analyzing movies in IMDb's database, it's possible to see significant numbers of `Documentaries`, `Drama` and `Comedy` movies. When looking at different combinations of genres, `Comedy + Drama` and `Comedy + Drama + Romance` have had the most No. of Movies over the last ten years. For Microsoft, these might be too saturated genres to enter but show a picture of the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Building a Fanbase:** During the analysis of the Most Voted/Best Rated movies, `Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi`, `Adventure, Animation, Comedy` and `Action, Adventure, Fantasy` showed up a lot over the last ten years. Those were the `genres` with the most No. of Movies in the Top 1% of movies in terms of number of votes. <br>I think the reason is that most of these movies are **superhero movies (Captain America, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Wonder Woman)**, part of a **movie series (Avengers, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Toy Story, Despicable Me)** or **Pixar Movies**. <br> **They attract a lot of fans over time. So once you have that fanbase, it becomes easier to create movies with a lot of views, votes and become popular.** <br>\n",
    "Therefore, a good strategy for Microsoft might be to enter this world and try to **partner with another company** like DC/Marvel and create an exclusive superhero series. The good thing about a partnership is that they wouldn't have to develop a new story since they would use an existing character. <br>Also, another option would be to develop a new `Adventure, Animation, Comedy` story with **unique characters like Minions on Despicable Me.** This one is a bit harder to execute, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Hire the best on roles that matter the most:** After analyzing **which roles were the most frequent in high voted movies**. The recommendation is to **focus on getting the best actors, then writers, producers, actresses, and directors**. _Note: Unfortunately, this analysis is biased towards men since actors have higher importance relative to actresses. And the reason is that there are more actors in high voted movies. I'd probably group both as the same to avoid adding this type of bias._\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Have an international footprint:** The **Average No. of Votes increases as the No. of Regions in which the movie is played increases**. Therefore, my recommendation for Microsoft would be to prepare to **launch the film internationally**.\n",

    "# Final Thoughts <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"final-thoughts\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "More could be done to gather more insights. For example, I'd like to see the number of Tickets Sold, viewers + demographics, and more information on which Platform/Studio created the movie. Moreover, understanding Microsoft's goals would also guide my analysis to relevant conclusions for them. For example, I don't know if they're trying to be profitable in this endeavor or if the goal is to enter this industry and then worry about profitability. "
